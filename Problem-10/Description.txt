1. Using Mathematical Operations (// and %)
✅ How it works:
    • % 10: Gets the last digit
    • // 10: Removes the last digit
    • Loop until the number becomes 0
📌 Code:
n = 9875
total = 0
while n > 0:
    total += n % 10
    n = n // 10
print(total)

2. Using String Conversion and Loop
✅ How it works:
    • Convert number to string
    • Loop through each character
    • Convert each digit back to int and sum them
📌 Code:
python
Copy code
n = 9875
total = sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
print(total)

Method
Time Taken (seconds)
// and % (Math)
0.65 seconds
String Conversion
0.87 seconds

    • Use math method (//, %) when you care about speed and performance.
    • Use string method when you want readability and ease of use, especially for small-scale or educational tasks.
