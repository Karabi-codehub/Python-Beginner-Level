🔁 Reversing a String Without Slicing:

Without slicing, we can reverse a string by using a loop. Here’s an example:

word = "cat"
new_word = ""

for letter in word:
    new_word = letter + new_word
print(new_word) 

Output: tac

How it works:
    • Start with an empty string ""
    • 
    • Take each character from the original string and add it to the front of the new string
      
letter
new_word
'c'
"c"
'a'
"a" + "c" = "ac"
't'
"t" + "ac" = "tac"


🔁 Reversing a String With Slicing:

word = "cat"
print(word[: : -1])

Output: tac

Index:   0   1   2
Letter: 'd' 'o' 'g'

How it works:
    • word[: :-1]
      word[start : stop : step]
      
    • Starting from the end 't', then move backward one step at a time: 't' → 'a' → 'c'
    • -1 means "go backward" . It reads the letters from end to start
