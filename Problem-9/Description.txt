🤔 What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until it reaches a base case.
🧒 Real-Life Example: Mirror Talking
Imagine you're playing a game in front of a mirror:
You say:
“Hey mirror, ask the next mirror to say hello!”
Now the next mirror repeats:
“Hey mirror, ask the next mirror to say hello!”
And this keeps going… until there’s no more mirror. Then the last one says:
“Hello!”
Each mirror asks the next mirror to do the same — just like a function calling itself!
🔁 That’s Recursion!
    • Each mirror = one function call
    • Next mirror = smaller version of the same problem
    • No more mirrors = base case

🐍 Code Example: Count Down Using Recursion
def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        print("Lift off!")  # Base case: stop here
    else:
        print(n)
        countdown(n - 1)    # Recursive call: smaller problem

countdown(5)
Output:
5
4
3
2
1
Lift off!
