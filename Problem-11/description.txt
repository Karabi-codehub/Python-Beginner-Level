🔍 Why check from 2 up to √n to test if a number is prime?
If n has a factor larger than √n,
then it must have a matching factor smaller than √n.
Example:
Let’s take n = 36
Its factors are:
    • (2 × 18)
    • (3 × 12)
    • (4 × 9)
    • (6 × 6) ← square root
    • (9 × 4)
    • (12 × 3)
    • (18 × 2)
Notice something?
Whenever there's a big factor (like 18), it's paired with a smaller factor (like 2).
And that smaller factor is less than or equal to √36 = 6.
we’re guaranteed there are no bigger factors either —
because they would have shown up as a pair with a smaller one.
You only need to check from 2 up to √n because:
    • If n is divisible by anything bigger than √n,
    • It’s also divisible by something smaller than √n.
So if you don’t find a divisor in that range, n is prime.
