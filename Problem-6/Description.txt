✅ What .title() Does:

The built-in .title() method in Python capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string and converts the rest of the letters to lowercase.

text = "hello PYTHON world"
print(text.title())  # Output: "Hello Python World"

🧠 .title() works — but not always how you expect!
    1. It capitalizes the first letter of each word, 
    2. but it also makes the rest of the word lowercase, which can mess up names, abbreviations, or acronyms.
       
✅ What We Use Instead

We manually:
    1. Split the sentence into words using .split()
    2. Capitalize the first letter of each word with word[0].upper()
    3. Add the rest of the word as it is with word[1:]
    4. Join the words back together with spaces using ' '.join(...)
